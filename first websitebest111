<h1>Raymond Chen</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Raymond Chen, I enjoy making YouTube videos because I can express myself more freely on the 
internet and chat with users(perhaps fans) that watches my videos!
</p>
<p>
I love playing Minecraft, because there are infinite possiblities and people can be as creative as possible
in their worlds. The soundtracks in the game are good, and the textures are simple and clean.
</p>
